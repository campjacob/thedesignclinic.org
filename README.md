# The Design Clinic

I broke my Jekyll site for my side hustle, web design business... and I finally decided to update it (although I'm not really sure if I'm planning on doing any design work at the moment).

It is forked from [Bootstrap 4 Github Pages](https://nicolas-van.github.io/bootstrap-4-github-pages/) which uses [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) start up project for [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
