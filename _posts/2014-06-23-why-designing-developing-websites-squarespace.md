Since transferring my own [personal website](http://jacobrcampbell.com/home) to [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com), and even making a couple of other Squarespace sites (check out my [website design projects](/website-design), I have really fallen in love with their platform. I first started hearing about Squarespace through many of the podcasts that I like to listen to. While I decided to not have this site hosted on Squarespace (mainly to continue to develop my programming skills), I do really love developing with their tools. Whenever I have anybody talk to me about website designs, the recommendation I always seem to give is Squarespace. I figured that I should share a little bit of why I am such a fan of developing on this great platform.

**Templates**

In all of my other website design endeavors, I have always made my own CSS (The style sheet that tells the webpage how to look), generally editing off of a preformed template, but always highly customized. Squarespace comes with a number of templates, but each one is so easily customized and highly editable that the sites I've developed don't look like any other website and it has a number of amazing features. For example, I absolutely love the parallax on the them I put together for my [mom's website](http://judydirks.com/).

**Rapid Development**

I can do a lot of things on a computer very quickly. I can even develop a pretty simple website at a pretty good pace, but nothing compares to how quickly I can have the basics a new Squarespace website put together. On [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w)(one of my favorite podcasts) they frequently tell about being able to set up a site in under 5 minutes, and it's very true.  While, I can put a Wordpress website up pretty quickly getting it to have a great looking theme can take significantly longer.

**Responsive Design**

Responsive design means that the website looks the same whether it's on your computer screen or your iPhone (yes, even your android phone). Squarespace's code is based on [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), a structure that I am liking more and more each and every day.

**Ease of Use**

Everything in Squarespace is drag and drop. This means that it is easy to use, takes minutes to put together, and just blissfully simple. It also doesn't require updating plugins and other activities which on my previous Drupal website took up a large portion of my time. You can get right to the writing.

**E-commerce**

While I don't sell anything, if I did, I'd really want to use their e-commerce tools. They are dead simple and turn out with a great product.

**Customer Service**

I've had to contact their customer service team a couple of times. They were responsive, funny (I was chatting with one of their team) and extremely helpful.

I really can't recommend Squarespace enough, they are really a pleasure to work with for design work. If you are interested in me putting together a website using Squarespace (or another web technology), please [contact me](/request-quote).
