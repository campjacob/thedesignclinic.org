I have been playing with graphic and web design since I first started community college in 2006. It has been quite a journey for me. I've gone from playing with the CSS for [MySpace](https://myspace.com/jacobshouse), to building my own website by hand, to using Google [Blogger](http://jacobshouse.blogspot.com), [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org), [Drupal](https://drupal.org), and now most recently my [personal website](http://jacobrcampbell.com) is hosted through [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com). I've picked up skills in CSS, HTML, and even a bit of PHP and JavaScript.

I spent quite a while investing into my personal website using Drupal, and added a lot of customized features and parts. I ended feeling that every time that I logged into my website I was having some trouble with the MySQL server (i.e. the database where all of the content is held), having to update plugins, or accidentally breaking stuff on my site. I decided to move to SquareSpace because it is so easy to use, with everything being drag and drop and never having to update plugins again. I've been absolutely loving my site hosted there, and don't have any current plans to change it.

As I have gotten more serious about my side job, The Design Clinic, I decided that it really needed it's own domain and website. I also decided, because I do offer web design services that, that I ought to be something that I can put some time into coding. I used [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) for the CSS and JavaScript backbone to give it the responsive design. I decided on using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) partially because it creates a static site verses a dynamic site. While I have some experience using PHP, I wouldn't qualify myself as a PHP developer. I also decided to use Jekyll to generate my site because it is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), and I feel that would be a much stronger programing and scripting language for me to learn and improve my skills in.

My current plan with The Design Clinic website is to have it mainly as a landing page for people who are interested in hiring me for my design services. I am also planning on using the blog to post some case examples of my design work. I'm really excited to be launching this new site.
