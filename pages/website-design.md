I create custom websites. I can create a website from scratch using popular CMS's (i.e. Wordpress, Drupal, Jekyll, Squarespace). [Send me a message and request a quote](/request-quote/).

The following are some websites that I have created. Every website that I create is designed to look great on a computer, tablet, and smart phone.


## Jacob Campbell's Personal Website

[My personal website](https://jacobrcampbell.com/) was hosted on [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com) currently. It has been customized and is a complete responsive design. You can see a mock up on different devices below from [Am I Responsive][1].

## Judy Dirks, A Wellness Guide for Living Well

[Judy Dirks's business website][3] is hosted on [Squarespace][4]. It has been customized and is a complete responsive design. You can see a mockup on different devices below from [Am I Responsive][5]. She is selling d≈çTERRA products, completing individual mental health treatment and training from a trauma informed perspective, and private consultations. I completed all of the copy writing on her website along with finding the various media and the logo design. I created it on Squarespace so that she would have an easy interface to be able to write blog posts at her [Sharing Wellness Blog][6].

## The Design Clinic

[The Design Clinic][8] is the home website for this business. I created with [Foundation][9] as the framework and build as static pages by [Jekyll][10]. The site is hosted on [GitHub][11]. While I am sure that it will be iterated on over the next couple of months and years, it has been fun to get back a bit closer to the metal and actually develop a website. It has been customized and is a complete responsive design. You can see a mock up on different devices below from [Am I Responsive][12].

## The Pasco Discovery Coalition

[The Pasco Discovery Coalition][14] is hosted on [Squarespace][15]. It has been customized and is a complete responsive design. You can see a mock up on different devices below from [Am I Responsive][16]. I act as the chairperson for their organization and decided that they needed a beautiful website to help promote themselves. They are an organization working on prevention of substance abuse in East Pasco. I completed all of the copy writing on her website along with finding the various media and the logo design. I created it on Squarespace to be able to offer a quick and beautiful design.

## The Prosser CIA Coalition

[The Prosser CIA Coalition][18] is hosted on [Squarespace][19]. It has been customized and is a complete responsive design. You can see a mock up on different devices below from [Am I Responsive][20]. I was asked to put together their website. I includes a number of different informational pages regarding their activities, a news section for recent events, and a calendar of events page for upcoming activities making it easier for their coalition to stay up to date.
